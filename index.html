						<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>I am currently a software engineer at <a href="https://www.seedfi.com/">SeedFi</a>. I studied Electrical and 
							Computer Engineering (Bachelor's May 2020) and Systems Engineering (MEng Fall 2020) at Cornell University. 
						</p>
						<p>I was born and raised in Manhattan Beach, California, a small, beachy suburb of Los Angeles. From a young
							age, I have loved going to the beach and being outside. I am also passionate about sustainability and
							music. I have played various brass and woodwind instruments throughout my life; notably, in the summer of 2019 
							I played baritone with the <a href="https://bluestars.org/">Blue Stars Drum and Bugle Corps</a>.</p>

									<h2>Music</h2>
									<p>I have been playing a music instrument since I was 9 years old. Most recently, the trombone and euphonium. At Cornell, I play the trombone in the Pep Band and the Marching Band while over the summer, I play Euphonium with <a href="http://www.pacific-crest.org/">Pacific Crest Drum and Bugle Corps</a>.</p>

									<h2>The Earth</h2>
									<p>Since November 2017, I have been a proud vegetarian. From a young age, I have been exploring natioanl parks throughout the western US. Being a vegetarian is the best way that I can fight global glimate change in my every day life, and to see the parks I grew up in stay beautiful.</p>

						<h3>Northrop Grumman Corporation</h3>
						<p>During the Summer of 2018, I interned at the Northrop Grumman Corporation in Redondo Beach, CA. As an
							intern, I worked with metrology engineers and learned how to perform manual and automated calibrations for
							lab equipment such as oscilloscopes, power supplies, and digital multimeters. I also calibrated AC/DC
							standard references and performed virus scans, sanitization and imaging on DC/LF and Radio Frequency
							measurement and test equipment.
							<!-- At the end of my internship, I led a team of 4 interns to develop a poster and presentation on metrology and its role in the company for the Northrop Grumman Explore Aerospace Poster Competition. -->

						<h3><a href="https://cusail.engineering.cornell.edu/">CUSail | Cornell Autonomous Sailboat Team</a></h3>
						<p>I am the Full Team Lead of CUSail. CUSail is a 33 member strong, interdisciplinary Cornell Engineering
							Project Team. We work together as a team to build a fully autonomous robotic sailboat for competition and
							oceanic research. As the lead, I oversee daily team operations and progress to ensure we are on track for
							competition in addition to handling team logistics and administration. In the past, I worked on the
							Mechanical Subteam. I designed the waterproofing systems and the deck and hull of the boat using CAD
							SolidWorks and eventually manufactuing the parts from composite materials such as fiber glass and carbon
							fiber. Learn more about CUSail <a href="https://cusail.engineering.cornell.edu/">here!</a></p>

						<h3>Project Spotlight</h3>
						<p>This past fall I took a course called Digital System Design Using Microcontrollers. Over the course of
							the semester, 2 of my peers and I created an air bass guitar that allows the user to play distinct notes
							by simply moving their fingers without the added weight and cost of an actual bass guitar using a PIC32
							microcontroller. The project uses flex sensors, beam break sensors, and an ultrasonic distance sensor to
							output sound that is accurate both in terms of frequency and duration. Check it out <a

						<h3>Peer Advising</h3>
						<p>I was an Engineering Peer Advisor for the 2018-2019 school year. During the year, I worked with a faculty
							advisor and co-peer advisor to create a lesson plan to aid a section of 14 new students in getting to know
							Cornell University and Cornell Engineering. I Co-led a weekly section and presented information about
							student life, enrollment processes, and appropriate university offices for academic and personal needs.
